# Banking Projects Using Machine Learning





## Projects List
- Boston House Price Prediction: Linear Regression.
- Classification whether a customer will be a defaulter or not using K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm.
- Qualitative Bankruptcy detection using K-Means Clustering.
- Stock Price Prediction using Neural Networks.
- Prediction of a person being a Subscriber to a bank based on Bagging, Boosting, Random forest etc  and compare all the models that have been built so far across different metrics.

## Generalized Approach
- Import required libraries.
- Perform EDA Analysis like shaping the data, checking datatype of each attribute, checking if there are null values and filling them with dummy values if they exist. 
- Checking if outliers exist, dealing with the outliers.
- Data Visualization.
- Splitting the data into train and test
- Training the model using different algorithms using train data.
- Testing using test data and evaluating using metrics like confusion matrix.
- Making predictions.
